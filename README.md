# Computer-Communications
Computer communication refers to the exchange of data between computers or devices using various transmission methods. It enables information sharing, remote collaboration, and internet connectivity. This communication can occur over wired (e.g., Ethernet cables) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular networks) connections. Protocols, like TCP/IP, govern data transfer, ensuring reliability and security. The Internet is a prime example of global computer communication, facilitating web browsing, email, and multimedia streaming. With the proliferation of IoT devices, computer communication has expanded to encompass smart homes, industries, and automation, revolutionizing how data is transmitted, received, and processed on a global scale.

## Types of Communication Protocols

Computer communication relies on a comprehensive suite of protocols that work together to facilitate efficient information exchange. These protocols can be broadly categorized into three main types:

1. Transport Protocols
2. Network Protocols
3. Application Protocols

### Transport Protocols

Transport protocols are responsible for ensuring the reliable transmission of data packets between computers. They are implemented at the operating system level and are responsible for handling errors, flow control, and segmentation/reassembly of data.

Some commonly used transport protocols include:

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable transmission of data by implementing mechanisms such as error checking, retransmission, and congestion control.

- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides faster, but less reliable data transmission. It does not guarantee the delivery of packets or maintain any record of past communication.
